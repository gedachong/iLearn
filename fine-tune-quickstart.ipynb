I just had to. \\n\\nFirst off, would it hurt for the workers to smile and greet customers? We were first timers and the menus were all over the place, I didn't even know where to look first. Seriously after 5 seconds of stepping inside, she goes \\\"What did you guys want?\\\" Wait what, excuse me? Not even a \\\"Hello! How are you?\\\" Or something.. Geez. \\n\\nHer monotonous voice and blank stare urged me to hurry up and figure out what I want so she doesn't get anymore pissed off. I opted for a Creamy Bun that everyone was hyping about and I got it with Cappuccino Crunch. It was very good, as I'm familiar with Thriftys ice cream. But dang, $5?! Idk about that.. Maybe $3.75 but not $5. The bf got a Honeydew Shaved Snow with Mochi, Popping Boba &amp; Condensed Milk drizzle. $5 as well? Talk about ripoff!\\n\\nHere's the thing, were avid fans of Snowflake Shavery &amp; shaved snow in general. Our cup was not filled with shaved snow/not filled up past the brim like the pictures on Yelp and Instagram, the toppings were tasty but a little more than a teaspoon would've been great and I didn't taste the condensed milk drizzle because well, it lacked of it.. We left totally unhappy, the girl was friendlier with the next customers who were young guys her age. Ugh!\\n\\nWhy us.. Why! We read and read the reviews here &amp; I was so ready to write a similar great review. Not impressed at all. I'd rather drive to Chinatown &amp; get legit shaved snow at a good price. Yuki may have more varieties and options to try but Snowflake Shavery wins with quality and quantity. Not sure if I'll try it again. Right now, I'm still in a sour mood from our visit.</td>\n",

We arrived around 10:20 p.m. and the late night menu which we had our eye on started at 11.\\n\\nWe decided to order a few cocktails and appetizers until the late night menu kicked in.  I tried the vodka cocktail and sampled the gin and the punch from others in our party.  The vodka cocktail was delicious with a wonderful hint of cinnamon.  The punch was delightful and tasted like mango nectar (dangerous, I could drink a dozen they were so good). The gin cocktail was much spicer, but still well balanced and delicious.  The first appetizer we ordered was Steak Tartare  with mussels, cilantro, nuoc cham, peanuts (description from website).  It was amazing.  The tartare  was fresh, cut perfectly and deliciously enhanced by the accompaniments.  The mussel was one of the tastiest morsels I have ever eaten.  We also ordered the Sashimi with squash, apple, wasabi.  The sashimi was hamachi and it was delicious.  Tender, fresh, wonderfully accompanied by the squash and apple.\\n\\nWe sampled the entire late night menu.  It sounds like a lot, but really only had three items: A burger, Korean fried chicken, and popcorn.  The Korean fried chicken was perfectly fried, not greasy, covered in a delicious sweet and spicy sauce.  The burger was outstanding! I can't say enough.  It was juicy, cheesy, spicy, delicious and the popcorn was great as well, deliciously seasoned and almost simple. \\n\\nI can not wait to return and try more of this innovative and delicious food.</td>\n",

But, given a long holiday weekend and the chance to rid myself of a restaurant.com gift certificate, we headed over for dinner this week.\\n\\nGiven that it was a Thursday night, the place had a few tables full but the seating was open and we even had our choice of a regular table or a higher bar top.  The crowd definitely felt \\\"Southpark\\\" with the dyed blonde, botox-frozen ladies sipping glasses of wine while glaring at the pretty young woman in the other corner who's got a much older man wrapped around her arm.  But, hey, that's the neighborhood, not Cyros' fault.  Glad to know they've been accepted by the locals.\\n\\nOur downward spiral began with the service.  Things never really clicked with our server, Gisele.  She was slow to come to the table, almost invisible when it came time for refills, and reluctant to come back to check on the food she had just served.  Now there were two other servers in the room who did a much better job- checking in with us and offering refills.  Had they been our server, there'd at least be another star here as both seemed to genuinely be concerned with the customer experience both at our tables and those surrounding us.\\n\\nFor apps, I went with the seaweed salad and we had an order of endamame to share.  Both were embarrassments.  For $5, the seaweed salad was the smallest portion I had ever.  I even took a picture and added it  to this page (see above).  It was literally served in what looked like a soy sauce dish.  We also had to send back the endamame because it was cold.  We saw another table do the same and overhead their server mention that they had a new guy in the back.  Whoa, if we can't get steamed soybean pods correct then we're not ready for primetime.\\n\\nWe then waited (and waited) for our sushi.  Nothing makes me more mad then seeing tables that arrived after us getting their meals ahead of us.  I tried to reconcile this by thinking we ordered some fancy rolls, but the other tables did the same.\\n\\nWe went with the wasabi roll, the avante garde, and the nobu fire.  While tasty, the rolls were pretty lose and did not hold up going from plate to soy sauce to mouth.  They just seemed kind of sloppily made, almost lazy.  It kinda fit the theme of the night.\\n\\nThe last insult was the bill.  Now I fully accept that the certificate says 18% gratuity will be added to the whole bill.  That's fine.  But the final bill came back with a 20% tip.  Here's the math- $52 total bill, $10.40 tip.  18% should have been $9.36.  Not enough to fight over, but it's safe to say I won't be back- not where there's better quality and better service just around the corner.</td>\n",
